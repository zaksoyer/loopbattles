/** ****************************************************************************
 * I created this routine to test a theory, I've learned long ago when I started 
 * programming, in the mid 90s.
 * 
 * Theory : the 'for..next' loop is the most efficient loop of all.
 * 
 * So using TypeScript, I created a 8 rounds battle between 'while..do' and 
 * 'for..next', computing the same simple maths problem.
 * 
 * x = x + y 
 * 
 * where x represents an integer initialized at a value of 10 and y the amount 
 * of cycles to execute for the round.
 * 
 * Rules followed:
 *  -Keep the coding as simple it can be,
 *  -Print only results,
 *  -Start with 1000 cycles
 *  -Add 1000 cycles per round
 * 
 * I know a lot of external factors that we can't know at the moment can also
 * influence the results, but this can gives an idea when it's time to use a loop
 * handling a lots of elements.
 * 
 * HOW YOU CAN USE THiS
 * --------------------
 * 
 * Just change the processing in the loops for the one you're planning to use
 * and you can have an idea of what the results will be!
